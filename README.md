# dotfiles

My dotfiles, my portable bash customisations. All based on bash.

These dotfiles are the customised extension based on [idearium/idearium/dotfiles](https://github.com/idearium/idearium/tree/master/dotfiles).

## idearium/dotfiles

To have this repository installed after the Idearium dotfiles, create an executable `custom.sh` containing the following:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smebberson/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash
```

Idearium dotfiles will do its thing, and then install further packages as per this repository.
